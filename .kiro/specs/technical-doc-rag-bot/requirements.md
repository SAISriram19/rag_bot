# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that answers user questions based on uploaded technical documents. The system operates entirely offline using Ollama with LLaMA3, ChromaDB for vector storage, and Gradio for the web interface. The bot specializes in technical documentation and includes advanced features like chat history, model switching, and dynamic file uploads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload technical documents (PDFs, text files, markdown) to the system, so that I can query information from these documents later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF, TXT, or MD file THEN the system SHALL process and ingest the document into the vector database
2. WHEN document processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message to the user
3. IF a document fails to process THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details
4. WHEN multiple documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process each document individually and store them in the same vector space

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about the uploaded technical documents, so that I can quickly find relevant information without manually searching through files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant document chunks using semantic similarity
2. WHEN relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL generate a response using LLaMA3 with the retrieved context
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL cite the source documents and show relevant context
4. IF no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the question cannot be answered from the available documents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the source context used to generate answers, so that I can verify the accuracy and relevance of the responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a response is generated THEN the system SHALL display the relevant document chunks used as context
2. WHEN showing context THEN the system SHALL include the source document name and relevant text snippets
3. WHEN multiple sources are used THEN the system SHALL clearly separate and label each source
4. WHEN context is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight or format it distinctly from the generated response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our conversation history, so that I can ask follow-up questions and maintain context across multiple queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL store the question and response in conversation memory
2. WHEN a follow-up question is asked THEN the system SHALL consider previous conversation context when generating responses
3. WHEN the conversation becomes too long THEN the system SHALL maintain a reasonable memory buffer to prevent performance issues
4. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL provide an option to clear conversation history

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different local LLM models, so that I can compare response quality and choose the best model for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL detect available Ollama models on the local system
2. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown or selection interface
3. WHEN a user switches models THEN the system SHALL use the selected model for subsequent responses
4. WHEN switching models THEN the system SHALL maintain the same conversation history and document context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload new documents during my session, so that I can dynamically expand the knowledge base without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a new document during an active session THEN the system SHALL process and add it to the existing vector database
2. WHEN new documents are added THEN they SHALL be immediately available for querying
3. WHEN processing new documents THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN document processing fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry or skip the problematic document

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle various technical document formats and structures, so that it can work with different types of technical documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL handle code blocks, technical diagrams descriptions, and structured content appropriately
2. WHEN chunking documents THEN the system SHALL preserve code snippets and technical context within chunks
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use appropriate models that understand technical terminology
4. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL prioritize technically relevant chunks over generic content

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to perform well with reasonable response times, so that I can have a smooth interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL respond within 10 seconds for typical queries
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for operations taking longer than 2 seconds
3. WHEN the vector database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable query performance
4. WHEN multiple users interact with the system THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test the system with various types of questions, so that I can understand its capabilities and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the system THEN it SHALL handle factual questions about technical concepts accurately
2. WHEN asked follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain context and provide coherent responses
3. WHEN asked specific technical questions THEN the system SHALL provide detailed answers with code examples when available
4. WHEN the system cannot answer a question THEN it SHALL clearly indicate the limitation rather than hallucinating information
