**Expected Behavior**: The system should provide direct, accurate answers to factual questions about the documentation.

**Examples**:
- Query: "What is the base URL for the REST API?"
- Expected: Direct answer with the URL from the API documentation
- Sources: Should cite the specific API reference document

#### Technical Implementation Questions
**Expected Behavior**: The system should provide code examples and step-by-step instructions for technical tasks.

**Examples**:
- Query: "How do I create a new user using the Python SDK?"
- Expected: Code snippet showing the SDK method call with required parameters
- Sources: Should reference SDK documentation

#### Architecture Questions
**Expected Behavior**: The system should explain architectural concepts and relationships between components.

**Examples**:
- Query: "What architectural pattern does the Project Service use?"
- Expected: Clear explanation of Clean Architecture and CQRS patterns
- Sources: Should reference architecture documentation

#### Follow-up Questions
**Expected Behavior**: The system should maintain context from previous questions and provide relevant follow-up information.

**Examples**:
- Initial: "What is the rate limit for API requests?"
- Follow-up: "How do I check the remaining rate limit?"
- Expected: Context-aware response building on the previous answer

### Source Citation

#### Accurate Source Attribution
**Expected Behavior**: All responses should include accurate citations to the source documents used.

**Criteria**:
- Source document names should match the actual files used
- Multiple sources should be clearly distinguished
- Source content should be relevant to the query

#### Source Relevance
**Expected Behavior**: Retrieved sources should be semantically relevant to the query.

**Quality Indicators**:
- High semantic similarity between query and source content
- Sources contain information that directly addresses the question
- No irrelevant or tangential sources included

### Response Quality

#### Completeness
**Expected Behavior**: Responses should comprehensively address all aspects of the query.

**Criteria**:
- All expected keywords/concepts are covered
- No important information is omitted
- Response provides sufficient detail for the user's needs

#### Accuracy
**Expected Behavior**: Responses should be factually correct and not contain hallucinated information.

**Quality Indicators**:
- Information matches the source documents exactly
- No contradictions with documented facts
- Appropriate uncertainty when information is not available

#### Clarity and Structure
**Expected Behavior**: Responses should be well-structured and easy to understand.

**Criteria**:
- Clear, concise language
- Logical organization of information
- Proper formatting for code examples and technical content

### Performance

#### Response Time
**Expected Behavior**: The system should respond within reasonable time limits.

**Targets**:
- Simple factual queries: < 3 seconds
- Complex technical queries: < 10 seconds
- Queries requiring multiple sources: < 15 seconds

#### Consistency
**Expected Behavior**: Similar queries should produce consistent response quality and timing.

**Criteria**:
- Repeated queries should yield similar results
- Response quality should not degrade over time
- Performance should be stable across different query types

## Known Limitations

### Document Processing Limitations

#### File Format Support
**Limitation**: Currently supports only PDF, TXT, and MD files.

**Impact**: Cannot process other common documentation formats like DOCX, HTML, or structured data formats.

**Workaround**: Convert unsupported formats to supported ones before upload.

#### Large Document Handling
**Limitation**: Very large documents (>10MB) may cause processing timeouts or memory issues.

**Impact**: Some comprehensive documentation sets may not be fully processable.

**Workaround**: Split large documents into smaller sections.

#### Code Block Preservation
**Limitation**: Complex code formatting may not be perfectly preserved during chunking.

**Impact**: Code examples might lose some formatting or context.

**Mitigation**: The system attempts to preserve code blocks, but manual verification is recommended.

### Query Understanding Limitations

#### Complex Multi-Part Questions
**Limitation**: Struggles with queries that contain multiple distinct questions or require complex reasoning.

**Example**: "How do I create a user and then add them to a project, and what are the security implications?"

**Impact**: May only address part of the question or provide incomplete answers.

**Workaround**: Break complex queries into separate, focused questions.

#### Domain-Specific Jargon
**Limitation**: May not understand highly specialized terminology not present in the training data.

**Impact**: Queries using uncommon technical terms may receive less accurate responses.

**Mitigation**: The system performs better when technical terms are defined in the uploaded documents.

#### Ambiguous References
**Limitation**: Cannot resolve ambiguous pronouns or references without clear context.

**Example**: "How do I configure it?" (without specifying what "it" refers to)

**Impact**: May provide generic or incorrect responses.

**Workaround**: Use specific terms and provide clear context in queries.

### Retrieval Limitations

#### Semantic Similarity Gaps
**Limitation**: May miss relevant content when query terms differ significantly from document language.

**Example**: Query uses "authentication" but document uses "login verification"

**Impact**: Relevant information might not be retrieved.

**Mitigation**: Try alternative phrasings or synonyms if initial results are unsatisfactory.

#### Cross-Document Reasoning
**Limitation**: Limited ability to synthesize information across multiple documents.

**Impact**: Queries requiring integration of concepts from different sources may be incomplete.

**Workaround**: Ask specific questions about individual documents first, then synthesize manually.

#### Context Window Limitations
**Limitation**: Can only consider a limited amount of context when generating responses.

**Impact**: Very long conversations may lose early context.

**Mitigation**: Periodically summarize or restart conversations for complex topics.

### Generation Limitations

#### Hallucination Risk
**Limitation**: May occasionally generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.

**Impact**: Users might receive inaccurate technical guidance.

**Mitigation**: Always verify critical information against source documents.

#### Code Generation Accuracy
**Limitation**: Generated code examples may contain syntax errors or logical issues.

**Impact**: Code snippets may need debugging before use.

**Mitigation**: Test all generated code before implementation.

#### Update Lag
**Limitation**: Cannot access information newer than the uploaded documents.

**Impact**: May provide outdated information if documents are not regularly updated.

**Mitigation**: Regularly refresh the document set with latest versions.

### Performance Limitations

#### Concurrent User Scaling
**Limitation**: Performance may degrade with many simultaneous users.

**Impact**: Response times may increase during peak usage.

**Mitigation**: Implement proper load balancing and resource scaling.

#### Memory Usage Growth
**Limitation**: Memory usage increases with document set size and conversation length.

**Impact**: System may become slower or unstable with very large datasets.

**Mitigation**: Monitor memory usage and implement cleanup procedures.

#### Model Dependency
**Limitation**: Performance is limited by the capabilities of the underlying LLM (LLaMA3).

**Impact**: Cannot exceed the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of the base model.

**Mitigation**: Consider upgrading to more capable models as they become available.
